# SpaceGame Assets

We use Code+Web's TexturePacker to create sprite sheets for our game. The sprite sheet is stored in
the `src/res/drawable/` directory.
The sprite sheets are created from the individual assets stored in the `Loose Files` directory.

TexturePacker also generates a handy xml-file that contains the coordinates of each sprite in
thesprite sheet.
This file is stored in the `src/res/raw/` directory.
